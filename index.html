        <p>Juba Parents Primary School, Juba, South Sudan</p>
        <p><strong>2022 - 2023</strong></p>
        <p>During my time as a teacher, I developed lesson plans, taught a variety of subjects, and helped young students improve their academic skills. I focused on creating an engaging learning environment, fostering a strong sense of teamwork, and developing creative problem-solving skills in students. My experience taught me the value of patience, communication, and adaptability in a dynamic classroom environment.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <div class="projects-content">
        <p>I am working on a project called <strong>Educare </strong>, which aims to connect youth with available job opportunities that match their skill sets. Through this initiative, I plan to apply my studies in software engineering to develop an application and website that will bridge the gap between job seekers and employers. This platform will enable young individuals to showcase their skills, view job opportunities, and directly interact with potential employers, breaking down barriers that limit hiring rates in our country.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to job matching, I intend to establish training programs that equip youth with essential skills. Many teenagers face challenges due to a lack of financial resources and emotional support to pursue their dreams. Therefore, I aim to empower them through workshops in various fields, including IT, business management, and vocational skill development, enabling them to become self-sufficient.</p>
        
        <p>This effort will not only assist in immediate employment but will also foster a sense of entrepreneurship and innovation among the youth.</p>
